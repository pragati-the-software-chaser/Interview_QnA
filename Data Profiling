Data Profiling:

Objective: Data profiling is the process of examining and summarizing the characteristics of data. 
It involves gathering metadata and statistical information about a dataset without actually analyzing the data's content.
Key Activities:
Identifying data types (e.g., text, numbers, dates).
Calculating summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
Detecting missing values, unique values, and duplicates.
Assessing data quality and data distribution.
Purpose: Data profiling helps in understanding the structure, quality, and content of data. 
It is typically the first step in data analysis and data preparation.
